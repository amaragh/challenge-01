# Code Refactoring of Horiseon Webpage

## Description

Code refactoring is integral to the coding process as it ensures code is written clearly and concisely. This allows the code to be accessible, avoids redundancy and lends itself to easier modification in the future.  

The Horiseon website, although functional, was not written with semantic HTML and had several redundancies within the CSS. I refactored the code within the HTML and CSS files to make it cleaner and more concise.

## Usage

The following general updates were made to the HTML:
* Renamed title to be more descriptive.
* Renamed various elements to use semantic HTML.
* Removed unused/unnecessary classes.
* Added a missing ID to a section which was referenced in the navigation bar.

The following general updates were made to the CSS:
* Added comments to demarcate sections.
* Reordered certain sections to follow the flow of the HTML sections.
* Replaced redudant selectors with more conise selectors. 

The Horiseon webpage was rendered continously throughout this process as updates were made to ensure that the code refactoring did not have any unwanted effects on the webpage.

The following images comprise the full Horiseon webage, which remained unchanged:
